# Refactoring Strategy
The strategy is to start refactoring the minitwit_tests.py first. This will be worked on by two or three group members. Once that is done, we will begin refactoring the minitwit.py3 file. The refactoring of the minitwit.py3 file will be done by three group members. To keep things simple, we will rewrite one feature at a time.

# Distributed Workflow

## Which repository setup will we use?
The repository model is to have two repos. One for the front-end and one for the back-end.

## Which branching model will we use?
For the branching model we will have a main branch that points to a development branch. We will work from branches according to features under development.

## Which distributed development workflow will we use?
The tasks will be divided amongst group members. Work in pairs or more when necessary. We will have reviewers for pull requests.

## How do we expect contributions to look like?
We aim for every group member to be involved in the projects doing different tasks. Sometimes contributions will be in pairs from pair programming and sometimes team members will work individually.

## Who is responsible for integrating/reviewing contributions?
Two group members will be responsible for reviewing/integrating contributions at a time to reduce the confusion that can occur when too many people are involved in such a task.
